# ***MrMineBOT***
A small program for the game, Mr. Mine, that lets you "sell all ores" and "forge gems" automatically.  

The program uses image recognition from *pyautogui* module to press certain buttons in a specific order. 

Image recognition is made for a *1920x1080 resolution display*. Other resolutions may not work - Haven't been tested with other resolutions.
Only tested on Windows.

This is just a small hobby project to keep learning Python.
